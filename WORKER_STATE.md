## Notes
Continuing translation work through Chapter 6 and into Chapter 7 "Пятно Роршаха" (Rorschach Blot). Pages 86-91 complete the dramatic events including Durov's middle finger to Mail.ru, his defiance against prosecutors, and culminate in his shocking deletion of co-founders Slava and Lev's VK accounts (id3 and id4). Now beginning Chapter 7 on page 92.
