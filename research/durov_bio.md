# Pavel Durov — Bio Notes (M0.4 draft)

## Quick profile
- **Name**: Pavel Valeryevich Durov (Павел Валерьевич Дуров)
- **Born**: 10 Oct 1984 (Leningrad / St. Petersburg)
- **Known for**: Founder of VKontakte (VK) and Telegram
- **Public persona**: Libertarian / anti-censorship; sharp, minimalist, “engineering-first”

## High-level timeline (needs page-level verification against the book)
- **Childhood**: Grew up in St. Petersburg; academic family background; early obsession with books + programming.
- **University (SPbU)**: Student projects; experimentation with online communities; early “internet-native” worldview.
- **2006**: Launches VKontakte (VK) during/after university period.
- **2007–2012**: VK scales rapidly into Russia/CIS mainstream; recurring tension between product ideals vs. business/political pressures.
- **2013–2014** (outside this book’s main window, but relevant context): conflict around control of VK; Durov exits VK; later focuses on Telegram.

## Key people / entities to watch for in the text
- **Nikolai Durov** (Николай Дуров): Pavel’s brother; mathematician/engineer; important technical role.
- **Mail.ru Group**: later VK ownership context (book may foreshadow early investor dynamics).
- **Russian state / regulators**: censorship and law enforcement pressure context (time-dependent).

## Voice / translation notes (for later M2 consistency)
- Durov is often framed as **uncompromising, provocative, and systems-oriented**.
- Preserve short, confident declarative rhythm; avoid “hero worship” tone drift in EN/ZH/JA.
