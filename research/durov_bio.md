# Pavel Durov — Biographical Notes (for translation context)

Scope: brief, **translation-oriented** notes for the period most relevant to the book (roughly 2000–2013), plus a small amount of later context that readers may expect.

## Snapshot

- **Name (RU)**: Павел Валерьевич Дуров  
- **Born**: 1984-10-10, Leningrad (now St. Petersburg), USSR/Russia  
- **Known for**: Founder of **VKontakte (VK)**; later founder of **Telegram**  
- **Public image**: privacy/anti-censorship stance, ascetic “product-first” persona, conflict with Russian authorities and major shareholders.

## Family / early environment (high-level)

- **Father**: Valery (Валерий) Durov — philologist / academic (often mentioned as shaping Pavel’s reading and “language” sensitivity).
- **Brother**: Nikolai Durov — mathematician/programmer; repeatedly cited as a key technical contributor in VK’s early era.

## Early internet / university-era projects (common motifs)

The book frequently frames early Durov as:
- **obsessed with systems** (rules, incentives, moderation)
- **drawn to anonymity/pseudonyms** and “online identity”
- **building student/community projects** before VK.

(Exact project names/details may appear per-page; verify against extracted text when translating.)

## VKontakte era (rough timeline anchors)

- **2006**: VK launched (often described as inspired by/compared to Facebook, but localized for Russian-speaking users).
- **2007–2011**: rapid growth; scaling and moderation; copyright/piracy disputes; increasing pressure from regulators and stakeholders.
- **By ~2011–2013** (book publication window): VK becomes the dominant social network in Russia/CIS; Durov becomes a symbolic “network-era” entrepreneur.

## Later context (reader expectations; outside book’s core)

- **2013**: Telegram appears (initially as a messenger emphasizing privacy/security).  
- **2014**: Durov leaves VK management/control after shareholder conflicts and political pressure (commonly summarized; details differ by source).

## Translation cues (how to render the persona)

- **Voice**: when Durov is quoted, expect **short, confident** lines; translate into EN/中文/日本語 with similar punch.
- **Ethos keywords**: freedom, autonomy, privacy, “no compromises,” anti-bureaucracy.
- **Avoid mythologizing**: the narrator (Kononov) sometimes admires, sometimes ironizes—preserve that balance.
