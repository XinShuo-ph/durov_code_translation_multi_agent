# Pavel Durov — bio notes (for translators)

## Core identifiers

- **RU**: Павел Валерьевич Дуров
- **EN**: Pavel Durov
- **中文**: 帕维尔·杜罗夫（常简称：杜罗夫）
- **日本語**: パーヴェル・ドゥーロフ（文脈で：ドゥーロフ）

## High-level timeline (translator orientation)

- **1984-10-10**: Born in Leningrad (now St. Petersburg), USSR/Russia.
- **Family**: Father Valery Durov (philologist); brother Nikolai Durov (mathematician/programmer; key early VK engineering).
- **2006**: Launches **VKontakte** (ВКонтакте / VK) while in/around university period; early growth driven by campus networks and Russian-speaking internet users.
- **2007–2012**: VK scales into the dominant social network in Russia/CIS; repeated pressure points around moderation, copyright, and state interest.
- **2013–2014** (post-book context): ownership/control conflict culminates; Durov exits VK leadership; later becomes synonymous with Telegram.
- **Telegram**: Often framed as privacy/anti-censorship oriented; relevant to the “Durov worldview” tone in later chapters.

## Voice / persona cues (useful for style)

- **Direct, sharp assertions**; often reads like a manifesto rather than neutral biography.
- **Anti-bureaucracy / anti-establishment** stance; favors “engineering truth” over “business etiquette”.
- **Aesthetic minimalism** and “principle-first” decision framing.

## Translation consistency notes

- Prefer **“VK”** as the short form after first mention (“VKontakte (VK)”).
- When the book uses **patronymics** or formal address, keep the register aligned:
  - EN: usually drop patronymic unless important in context.
  - 中文/日本語: keep formality markers (先生/氏) only when the scene’s social distance requires it.
