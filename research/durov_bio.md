## Don Quixote Connection
- Book opens with young Durov reading Cervantes
- Symbolic: Durov as idealist fighting windmills (establishment, conventions)
- Durov identified with Don Quixote's principled but impractical idealism
- Father's philology background likely introduced him to classics

## Research Sources for Translation
- VKontakte platform itself (user interface, features)
- Russian tech journalism (Habr.com, VC.ru)
- International coverage (TechCrunch, Wired articles on Durov)
- Later Telegram coverage (for understanding his trajectory)
- St. Petersburg cultural context

## Translation Notes
- Name transliteration: "Durov" (English), "杜罗夫" (Chinese), "ドゥーロフ" (Japanese)
- VKontakte: Keep as "VKontakte" or "VK" in all languages (brand name)
- Preserve his unconventional, direct speaking style
- Cultural references (Don Quixote, St. Petersburg) need localization notes
