## Working assumptions / reminders

- **Page numbers** refer to PDF page order (1–99) as used by the project protocol.
- For M2 translation, treat each page as an independent JSON unit (`translations/raw/page_XXX.json`) but keep terminology consistent across chapter boundaries.
- If the extracted text (`research/durov_code_book_ru.txt`) shows major OCR/layout artifacts in any section, note it in translator notes for affected pages.
