# VKontakte (VK) History

## Origins (2006)
- **Concept**: Pavel Durov, inspired by Facebook, wanted to create a social network for Russian university students using real names.
- **Founders**: Pavel Durov, Vyacheslav Mirilashvili (provided capital), Lev Leviev.
- **Launch**: Beta testing in summer 2006 under domain `vkontakte.ru`. Officially launched October 10, 2006 (Durov's 22nd birthday).
- **Early Growth**: invitation-only initially, then opened to SPbGU, then all universities.

## Rapid Expansion (2007-2010)
- **2007**: Became the second largest social network in Russia, overtaking Odnoklassniki in daily usage.
- **Features**: Clean interface, fast loading, audio/video hosting (which became a major driver of growth due to piracy).
- **User Base**: Reached 10 million users in 2008.
- **Corporate Structure**: Headquartered in St. Petersburg (Singer House).

## The Mail.ru Conflict (2010-2014)
- **DST/Mail.ru**: Digital Sky Technologies (later Mail.ru Group) bought stakes from early investors (Mirilashvili, Leviev).
- **Tension**: Durov resisted monetization pressure and "trashy" ads, preferring a clean user experience.
- **Trash Heap**: In 2011, Durov tweeted a photo of himself giving the finger to Mail.ru's acquisition offer.
- **Ownership Changes**: Mirilashvili and Leviev sold their 48% stake to UCP (United Capital Partners) in 2013, creating a hostile environment for Durov.
- **Durov's Exit**: In 2014, Durov sold his remaining 12% stake to Ivan Tavrin (who sold to Mail.ru). Mail.ru Group eventually gained 100% control.

## Post-Durov Era (2014-Present)
- **Management**: Controlled by Mail.ru Group (now VK Company).
- **Changes**: More aggressive monetization, algorithmic feed, integration with other Mail.ru services, cooperation with Russian authorities.
- **Status**: Remains the dominant social network in Russia and CIS.

## Key Features & Cultural Impact
- **The Wall (Стена)**: Central feature for user expression. Durov's removal of the Wall in favor of "Microblog" caused massive user protest ("Durov, return the wall!").
- **Audio/Video**: Served as a massive unregulated library of music and movies for years.
- **Durov's Code**: The book focuses on the "code" not just as software, but as Durov's moral and ethical code that shaped the company's DNA (until his departure).
