# VKontakte (VK) — history notes (for translators)

## Names & rendering

- **RU**: «ВКонтакте» (often “ВК”)
- **EN**: VKontakte (VK)
- **中文**: VKontakte（VK / “VK社交网”视语境）
- **日本語**: VKontakte（VK / 「ヴコンタクテ」表記は必要時のみ）

## What VK is (one-line)

Russian social network launched in 2006; often described as “the Russian Facebook”, but with its own product culture and local internet norms.

## Time window relevant to the book (approx. 2006–2012)

- **Launch / early growth**: rapid adoption among students; expansion to broader Russian-speaking audiences.
- **Product themes**: identity profiles, messaging, groups/communities, media sharing; friction around piracy/copyright and content moderation.
- **Operations**: fast iteration culture; engineering-led decision making; “move fast” style in a Russian business environment.
- **External pressures**: media scrutiny, rights holders, and state interest in social platforms.

## Translation pitfalls

- Don’t over-literalize “Russian Facebook”: in EN/中文/日本語, treat it as a **journalistic analogy**, not an identity claim.
- Be careful with **company vs. product** references: “VK” can mean the platform, the company, or the team depending on the sentence.
