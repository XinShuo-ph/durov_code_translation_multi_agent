# VKontakte (VK) History

## Origins (2006)
- **Launch**: Beta testing began in summer 2006; officially launched October 10, 2006 (Durov's 22nd birthday).
- **Name**: "VKontakte" means "In Contact". Originally "Student.ru" was considered but rejected to aim for a broader audience.
- **Initial Growth**: Closed registration (invite-only) initially, then opened. Grew virally through university networks.

## The Golden Age (2007-2010)
- **User Base**: Exploded to millions of users, overtaking established competitors like Odnoklassniki.
- **Features**: Wall, audio/video hosting (which became a massive piracy haven/library), groups, apps platform.
- **Monetization**: Introduced "Voices" (internal currency) and targeted ads, but Durov resisted cluttering the interface with banners.
- **Office**: Moved to the iconic Singer House (Dom Knigi) in St. Petersburg, occupying the top floors.

## Corporate Wars (2011-2014)
- **Ownership Structure**: Originally owned by Durov, Vyacheslav Mirilashvili, and Lev Leviev.
- **Mail.ru Group**: Yuri Milner's DST (later Mail.ru Group) bought stakes from other co-founders. Durov held a minority stake but controlled the voting rights via proxy.
- **The "Trash" Gesture**: In 2011, Mail.ru tried to buy 100% of VK. Durov responded by posting a photo of himself giving the finger to the camera (captioned "Official response to Mail.ru trash-holding").
- **2011 Protests**: VK became a hub for political organization. FSB demanded blocking of opposition groups; Durov refused (tweeted a dog in a hoodie).

## The Fall of Durov (2013-2014)
- **Traffic Incident**: In 2013, Durov was accused of running over a police officer (he denied it, claiming he doesn't drive). Police raided VK office.
- **UCP Entry**: United Capital Partners (UCP) secretly bought 48% of VK from Mirilashvili and Leviev, creating a hostile faction against Durov/Mail.ru.
- **Telegram Split**: Durov started focusing on Telegram, accused by UCP of using VK resources.
- **April Fool's Resignation**: April 1, 2014, Durov posted a resignation note. Later said it was a joke.
- **Final Ouster**: On April 21, 2014, VK management accepted his "resignation" (claiming he didn't withdraw it formally). Durov learned about his firing from the news.
- **Mail.ru Takeover**: Mail.ru Group eventually bought out UCP, consolidating 100% ownership.

## Post-Durov Era
- **Management**: Boris Dobrodeev took over.
- **Changes**: Increased monetization, smart feed (algorithmic), integration with Mail.ru ecosystem (VK ID, VK Pay).
- **State Control**: Generally viewed as cooperating more closely with Russian state authorities regarding data requests and censorship.
