# VKontakte (VK) History

## Founding (2006)
- **Launch**: October 10, 2006, as a closed network for university students (similar to early Facebook).
- **Name**: "VKontakte" (In Contact) - chosen to be neutral and not tied to a specific university.
- **Founders**: Pavel Durov (concept, design, frontend), Nikolai Durov (backend, architecture), Vyacheslav Mirilashvili (investor), Lev Leviev (investor).
- **Domain**: Originally vkontakte.ru (later vk.com).

## Early Growth (2007-2010)
- **2007**: Opened registration to everyone. Rapid growth to millions of users. Became the second most visited site on RuNet.
- **Key Features**: "The Wall" (microblogging), Audio/Video hosting (became a huge driver of traffic due to piracy/loose copyright enforcement), Groups/Communities.
- **Monetization**: Initially resisted ads. Introduced "Voices" (internal currency) for gifts and games. Later targeted ads.
- **Architecture**: Built on C++ (custom engine KPHP later), heavily optimized for speed.

## The Corporate War (2011-2014)
- **Mail.ru Group**: Yuri Milner's DST (later Mail.ru Group) bought stakes from Mirilashvili and Leviev.
- **2011**: Mail.ru Group wanted to buy 100% of VK. Durov posted a photo of himself giving the finger to Mail.ru ("trash-holding").
- **December 2011**: FSB demanded VK shut down opposition groups during protests. Durov refused.
- **2013**: Mirilashvili and Leviev sold their 48% stake to UCP (United Capital Partners), a fund with ties to the Kremlin, without offering it to Durov/Mail.ru first (violating shareholder agreement, according to Durov).
- **The Standoff**: UCP vs. Durov/Mail.ru. UCP accused Durov of using VK resources to build Telegram.

## Durov's Exit (2014)
- **January 2014**: Durov sold his 12% stake to Ivan Tavrin (MegaFon CEO, ally of Usmanov/Mail.ru).
- **April 1, 2014**: Durov announced resignation (later said it was an April Fool's joke).
- **April 21, 2014**: Durov was fired by the board (citing procedural technicalities of his resignation withdrawal).
- **Result**: Mail.ru Group eventually acquired UCP's stake, gaining 100% control of VK.

## Book Context
The book "Durov Code" covers the period from the founding up to roughly 2012-2013, focusing on the startup phase, the unique culture ("Zinger House"), and the beginning of the corporate/political pressure.
