# VKontakte (VK) — History Notes (for translation context)

These notes focus on **concepts likely to appear in the narrative**: growth, product choices, moderation/censorship, monetization, and shareholder conflict.

## What VK is (simple framing)

- **RU name**: «ВКонтакте» (often shortened to «ВК»)  
- **EN**: VKontakte / VK  
- **Category**: large-scale social network for the Russian-speaking internet (profiles, messaging, groups, media sharing).

## Rough timeline anchors (translation-oriented)

- **2006**: launch and early adoption among students/early adopters.
- **2007–2009**: growth phase; platform features expand (groups, media, messaging); infrastructure scaling becomes a key storyline.
- **2010–2012**: mainstream dominance; growing external pressure (copyright, law enforcement requests, political sensitivity); monetization and corporate governance become central.
- **2012–2013**: by publication time, VK is a national-scale platform; internal conflicts intensify in many retellings.

## Common recurring themes in the book

- **Product ideology**: fast iteration, minimal bureaucracy, “engineer’s control” vs corporate control.
- **Moderation**: balancing free expression with legal/commercial constraints; handling spam, piracy, extremist content accusations, etc.
- **Infrastructure**: servers, traffic spikes, outages, caching, content delivery—technical vocabulary will recur.
- **Business reality**: investment, ownership stakes, board dynamics; Russian business culture; “who really controls the company.”

## Naming consistency suggestions

- Prefer **“VK”** after first mention, unless the Russian text emphasizes the full brand «ВКонтакте».
- Translate «соцсеть» as **“social network”** / **“社交网络”** / **“SNS”** depending on sentence tone.
