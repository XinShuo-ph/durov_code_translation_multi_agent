# VKontakte (VK) — History Notes (M0.5 draft)

## What VK is
VKontakte (ВКонтакте, commonly “VK”) is a Russian-language social network that grew into the largest social platform in Russia/CIS, often compared with Facebook in function but culturally distinct.

## High-level timeline (needs page-level verification against the book)
- **2006**: VK launched (often cited as Oct 2006).
- **2007–2008**: early growth; feature velocity; community/network effects dominate.
- **2009–2011**: scaling to mass adoption; moderation + piracy/content issues become material; business structure and investor relationships deepen.
- **2012**: VK is a core Russian internet utility; pressure vectors: money, media attention, and politics.

## Themes likely to appear in-book
- **Product focus vs. governance**: founder control vs. shareholder/investor constraints.
- **Russian internet culture**: “social network as default identity layer” for a generation.
- **Operations at scale**: rapid growth without “corporate polish”; engineering pragmatism.

## Translation notes
- Company name should remain **VKontakte (VK)** in EN; **ВКонтакте** as RU; **VK** in ZH/JA with a first-mention expansion if needed.
- When the book uses informal register (“ВК”), keep it informal in EN/ZH/JA.
