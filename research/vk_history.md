# VKontakte (VK) — History (Context Notes)

These notes are for translation consistency and historical orientation.

## What VK is
- **Name**: VKontakte (ВКонтакте), commonly **VK**
- Often described as “Russian Facebook”, but culturally/technically it evolved with distinct norms: open groups, massive media sharing, and a central role in Russian-language internet identity.

## Timeline (high level)
- **2006**: VK launches; early audience: students / young people.
- **2007–2008**: First major funding and scaling period; core team forms; product decisions prioritize speed and user growth.
- **2009–2012**: Becomes a dominant Russian social network; monetization and business-control conflicts intensify; external pressure increases.
- **2014** (post-book context): Ownership changes culminate in Durov’s departure; VK consolidates under larger corporate control.

## Key themes in the book’s VK narrative
- **Engineering-first culture**: small team, intense coding cycles, product debates framed as ideology (what a social network “should be”).
- **Growth vs. governance**: rapid user growth forces hard choices (moderation, copyright, platform rules).
- **Capital & control**: investors/partners vs. founder vision; negotiations with large incumbents (notably Russian internet conglomerates).
- **Politics & pressure**: VK as a communications hub becomes politically sensitive; tension between state demands and a “free internet” posture.

## Common terms to keep consistent (recommended)
- **ВКонтакте**: VKontakte / VK (EN), 领英? (No) → **VK / “VKontakte（VK）”** (ZH), **VK / ヴコンタクテ** (JA; often “VK” is enough)
- **соцсеть**: social network / social media platform; 中文 often **社交网络/社交平台**; 日本語 **SNS**
- **дом Зингера** (Zinger House): landmark building in St. Petersburg used as VK office setting in the book.
