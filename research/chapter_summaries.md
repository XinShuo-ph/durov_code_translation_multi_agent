## Предисловие (Preface) - Pages 5-6
**Author**: Юрий Сапрыкин (Yuri Saprykin)

### Summary
The preface, written by journalist and editor Yuri Saprykin, frames the book as a rare documented story in a Russia full of "lost stories" - epic tales that go unrecorded. He describes VKontakte as a mysterious phenomenon that dominates Russian internet culture, especially among youth. The logo "flickers on every monitor in the country."

Saprykin presents Pavel Durov as an exceptional, eccentric figure who defies categorization. He warns readers not to read this as a "Hero of Our Time" portrait or prediction of the future, but rather as an adventure novel with an uncertain ending. He notes Durov's key trait: the drive to do everything "against the system" and break the frames people try to put him in.

### Key Themes
- Russia's undocumented tech history
- VKontakte as cultural phenomenon
- Durov as unconventional figure
- Freedom as core value

### Translation Notes
- "Lost stories" (потерянные сюжеты) - literary/journalistic metaphor
- References to Rambler-Afisha media group

## Пролог (Prologue) - Pages 7-12
**Location**: Singer House, Nevsky Prospekt, St. Petersburg

### Summary
The prologue opens with a dramatic scene: a business negotiation on the 6th floor of the Singer House. A foreign e-commerce executive is negotiating with VKontakte to integrate a "Gifts" feature. Three VKontakte representatives sit across from him: a programmer with a laptop, a negotiator at the window, and a seemingly quiet figure in a black baseball cap.

The negotiation becomes heated when the quiet figure (Durov) suddenly erupts, demanding 20% commission and threatening to end the meeting. His unpredictable behavior - shifting between awkward teenager, aggressive businessman, and refined intellectual - throws the foreign executive off balance. The VKontakte team ultimately wins the negotiation.

The author then reflects on how nerds have reshaped the world. He recalls how he came to write this book, initially meeting resistance from Durov, who said he "didn't care about money" and didn't want to talk to Forbes. Their late-night conversation about entrepreneurship became the starting point for the book.

### Key Scenes
1. The negotiation with the e-commerce company
2. The quirky VKontakte office culture (rooms with strange names)
3. Author's reflections on how technology changed consciousness
4. The genesis of this book

### Key Themes
- Nerds vs. traditional business
- VKontakte's independent culture
- Social networks as "collective nervous system"
- Author's journey into VKontakte world

### Translation Notes
- "attack dog" - kept in English in original (переговорщик жесткий)
- Office room names: "Сквот ИЕ" (IE Squat), "Наркомпросвет" (Soviet education reference)
- Reference to Paul Graham essay "Why Nerds Are Unpopular"

## Глава 1: Ботанический сад (Chapter 1: Botanical Garden) - Pages 13-22

### Summary
The chapter opens with a vivid description of young Pavel reading Cervantes on an abandoned military bunker in St. Petersburg's Primorsky district - a bleak, partially-constructed neighborhood near the Gulf of Finland. His older brother Nikolai is described as a prodigy who read at age 3 and solved cubic equations at 7.

The family moved to Turin, Italy when their father took a professorship there. Pavel was initially left with his grandmother in Leningrad, an experience that deeply affected him. He later joined the family in Italy, where Nikolai appeared on a TV show for child prodigies.

Returning to Russia, Pavel's confrontational personality emerged at school. He challenged teachers he deemed incompetent, leading to conflicts. His parents, both intellectuals, supported his independent thinking.

Through family connections, Pavel entered the "General Education Classes" (Общеобразовательные классы) - an experimental classical education program founded by the Rusakovs. There he befriended Slava Mirilashvili, son of a gambling magnate, who would later become an investor.

The school itself was embattled - constantly threatened by authorities, moving between locations, surviving on teacher enthusiasm. The director, nicknamed "Griz" (from grizzly bear), nurtured independent thinkers. Teachers included a biologist who taught evolution theory (which fascinated Durov) and a psychoanalysis specialist who introduced Durov to Freud and IQ research.

### Key Events
- Childhood in bleak St. Petersburg outskirts
- Family's time in Italy
- Conflicts with teachers
- Entry to experimental classical gymnasium

- Intellectual awakening through unconventional teachers

### Key Themes
- Formation of contrarian personality
- Importance of quality education
- Social class and privilege (Mirilashvili friendship)
- Anti-authoritarian tendencies
- Competition and meritocracy ideology

### Translation Notes
- "Ботанический сад" (Botanical Garden) - ironic title, also refers to "ботаники" (nerds)
- "Гопники" - street thugs, important Russian subculture
- Primorsky district - specific St. Petersburg geography
- Napoléon Hill's "Think and Grow Rich" referenced
- Oblomov discussion - classic Russian literary debate

## Глава 2 (Chapter 2) - Pages 23-37

### Summary
This chapter covers Durov's university years at St. Petersburg State University's Philology Faculty. He created a popular student forum (spbgu.ru/forum) and developed marketing skills through promoting it.

A major arc involves Durov organizing a "Beauty and Design Contest" for female students - partly inspired by Zuckerberg's Harvard story. The event served as marketing for his forum and demonstrated his ability to organize, negotiate with sponsors, and generate controversy (and thus engagement).

Durov formed a group called "the Mafia" - young men in black who supported his projects. Key figures included Ilya Perekopsky (a charismatic "totem" who became his business partner) and Mikhail Ravdolikas. They adopted a provocative, theatrical style.

The chapter also covers his first encounter with programming as a means of changing the world. Durov was deeply influenced by "The Matrix" philosophy (references to Neo, Morpheus throughout) and libertarian ideas. He developed sophisticated manipulation and persuasion techniques to grow his forum.

### Key Events

## Глава 3 (Chapter 3) - Pages 38-50

### Summary
This chapter covers the founding of VKontakte in October 2006 and its early explosive growth. Durov and his brother Nikolai created the site, with Nikolai providing technical genius.

The chapter details conflicts with competitor MoiFakultet.ru, including accusations (which Durov denied) of hacking. Key design decisions are explained: the neutral blue-gray color scheme (inspired by psychology lessons), the decision to make personal profiles the landing page (uniquely Russian innovation), and the minimalist logo.

Early growth tactics included: buying iPods to give away (1,000 of them) to users who invited friends, targeting Moscow State University forums, and requiring invitations to join (creating exclusivity).

Technical challenges emerged quickly. When the site crashed in February 2007, Durov and Nikolai worked with consultant Oleg Bunin to learn server architecture. Nikolai's ability to implement complex server configurations in hours (usually a week's work) amazed professionals.

The chapter establishes Slava Mirilashvili's return as investor, providing crucial early funding. VKontakte grew from hundreds of thousands to millions of users rapidly.

### Key Events
- VKontakte launch (October 10, 2006)
- Competition with MoiFakultet.ru

## Глава 4 (Chapter 4) - Pages 51-64

### Summary
This chapter covers VKontakte's rapid scaling phase and the building of its unique corporate culture. The team moved into the Singer House (Дом Зингера), establishing the iconic 6th-floor headquarters.

The chapter explores how a small team of elite programmers (~30 people) managed infrastructure for tens of millions of users. VKontakte developed its own custom solutions, with Nikolai Durov as chief architect.

The company culture was explicitly anti-corporate: flat hierarchy, programmer-centric values, long hours by choice, quirky room names, and casual dress. Durov's leadership style - demanding excellence but giving creative freedom - attracted top talent.

Monetization began through virtual gifts, games, and advertising. The chapter addresses the piracy controversy - VKontakte became a massive repository for music and video, with Durov taking a permissive approach to content.

### Key Events
- Move to Singer House headquarters
- Team building and culture establishment
- Development of monetization
- Managing massive scale

## Глава 5 (Chapter 5) - Pages 65-78

### Summary
This chapter covers the business conflicts that emerged as VKontakte grew valuable. Multiple investors - including Mail.ru Group - sought to acquire or control the company. Durov fought to maintain independence.

Key conflicts included battles over company direction, monetization strategies, and content policies. External pressure came from rights holders (music, film), government authorities wanting user data, and competing business interests.

The chapter explores Durov's uncompromising stance on independence. He refused to sell control, clashed with investors who wanted faster monetization, and resisted government censorship requests.

The 2011-2012 Russian protests become important context. Durov refused to limit Alexei Navalny's opposition group, making VKontakte a platform for political organization despite pressure.

## Глава 6 (Chapter 6) - Pages 79-91

### Summary
This chapter explores Durov's personal philosophy and worldview. It delves into his intellectual influences, political views, and vision for technology's role in society.

Key philosophical threads include: libertarian ideals, anti-censorship absolutism, belief in transparency, and technology as liberation. The chapter includes Durov's public statements and provocations - including the famous Victory Day (May 9) tweet criticizing celebration of a victory that "returned the country to a tyrant."

His personal style is examined: the minimalist black clothing, vegetarianism, fitness focus, social media persona with millions of followers. The Faust quote ("Vi veri universum vivus vici") encapsulates his self-image.

The chapter addresses contradictions: a privacy advocate who collects user data, an anti-capitalist who became a millionaire, a recluse who cultivates public image.

### Summary
The final chapter looks toward the future (as of 2012). It speculates on VKontakte's trajectory, Durov's next moves, and larger questions about social networks and society.

The author reflects on what he's learned writing this book. He positions Durov as part of a new generation of tech entrepreneurs who see building products as a form of social change, not just business.

The chapter ends with uncertainty - the "adventure novel" doesn't have a clear ending. Will Durov maintain control? Will VKontakte survive Russian political pressures? What comes next?
