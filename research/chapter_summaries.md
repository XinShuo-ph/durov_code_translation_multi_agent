## Предисловие / Preface (Pages 5-6)
**Author of Preface**: Yuri Saprykin (Юрий Сапрыкин)

### Summary
The preface establishes the significance of the book in capturing a rare, documented story from post-Soviet Russia. Saprykin notes that Russia is full of untold stories of Shakespearean drama—empires falling, fortunes made and lost—yet few are properly documented. He describes VKontakte as a mysterious world that dominates young Russians' lives, with its blue logo ever-present in browsers.

### Key Points

- VKontakte is ubiquitous among Russian youth
- The platform's influence is growing generationally
- This book is rare in documenting a contemporary Russian tech story

### Translation Notes
