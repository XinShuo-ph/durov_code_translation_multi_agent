# Chapter Summaries (working draft)

These are **translation-oriented** summaries to maintain narrative continuity and consistent tone across pages.

## Предисловие (pp. 5–6)

Essay-style introduction about why modern Russia produces “Shakespearean” stories that often go undocumented; frames this book as rare narrative capture of a major contemporary phenomenon (VK and its founder).

## Пролог (pp. 7–12)

Opens with a vivid scene in St. Petersburg’s **Singer House (Дом Зингера)**: a tense negotiation between a foreign internet commerce executive and VK’s young technical founders. Establishes key motifs: platforms as territory, monetization as power, Durov’s negotiation style, and the book’s “thriller in binary code” framing. Ends with authorial meta-commentary on method and references (e.g., Douglas Adams’ “So long, and thanks for all the fish”).

## Глава 1 — «Ботанический сад» (pp. 13–22)

Childhood and early identity formation: St. Petersburg outskirts, harsh wind/landscape, “nerd vs gopniks” tension, obsessive reading, family environment, and early signs of the worldview that later becomes a product ideology. Closes on the “internet totem” self-definition (aspiration to become a symbolic node of influence).

## Глава 2 — «Архитектор» (pp. 23–37)

University-era experimentation and persona-building: Durov and associates run selective clubs/competitions (durov.com branding, high-status aesthetics), test social dynamics, recruit/coordinate talent, and learn how to shape communities. Key relationship/counterparties appear (e.g., Ilya Perekopsky). Ends around an escalating bet/goalpost (“million” challenge) that foreshadows the founding leap.

## Глава 3 — «Мафия открывает глаза» (pp. 38–50)

Origin story of VK’s early business formation: introduction of partners/investors and the post-2000s Russian business backdrop. The narrative brings in major stakeholders (e.g., Slava Mirilashvili, Lev Leviev, Yuri Milner/DST) and frames investment/deal-making as a strategic “game.” Ends around the first major investment structure and the shift from student project to high-stakes platform.

## Глава 4 — «Сок черешни» (pp. 51–64)

Scaling period: intense coder “monastic” lifestyle (shared apartment-office, nocturnal work), ideology debates (“what should a platform for developers be?”), and the move from improvised setup to prestigious city-center office space. The stakes expand: independence becomes a contested asset; the first clear signals of larger corporate pressure appear.

## Глава 5 — «Стена» (pp. 65–78)

Corporate conflict and escalation: Mail.ru ecosystem enters as a strategic threat; public statements, ultimatums, and influence games intensify. Durov is framed as someone who “likes conflict as a way to keep spirit up,” leaning into confrontation and using platform levers as power.

## Глава 6 — «Запрещенный прием» (pp. 79–91)

High drama phase: street violence brushes the VK team; reality begins to mirror the team’s own “war” metaphors and cultural references. The “Mafia game” framing sharpens—alliances, betrayals, and governance struggles. A symbolic turning point occurs when key shareholders’ accounts are deleted, signaling that Durov’s interest is shifting beyond VK’s internal battles.

## Глава 7 — «Пятно Роршаха» (pp. 92–98)

Exit vectors and “next quest”: fatigue from VK’s constraints, attempted global expansion, and recognition of structural disadvantages abroad. The narrative pivots to **mobile messaging** as an entry point to global personal communications, noting competitors and their weaknesses. Ends with Durov’s quasi-mystical model of success (“enthusiasm and faith vs fear”) and a broader thesis about “activist capitalism” and entrepreneurs as future leaders.

## Об авторе (p. 99)

Short biography of Nikolai Kononov (journalist/editor; Forbes RU background; Hopes & Fears; prior book on Russian entrepreneurs).

## Recurring translation-sensitive references (non-exhaustive)

- **Pop culture**: “Pirates of Silicon Valley,” “The Matrix,” “Sucker Punch,” Eurythmics (“Sweet Dreams”), demotivators.
- **Anglicisms**: “tweak,” “attack dog,” tech vocabulary; keep register consistent.
- **Slang**: «ботаник», «гопник», «менеджерьё»—often needs cultural handling/notes.
