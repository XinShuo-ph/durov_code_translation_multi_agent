# Chapter Summaries (M0.7 — starter draft)

Status: **draft** — anchored where possible to extracted text; still needs full read-through verification.

## Preface (pp. 5–6)
- Frames modern Russia as a place where big stories happen but are rarely recorded; sets up VK/Durov as one such story worth documenting.
- Positions Durov as exceptional and hard to generalize from (“don’t read this as a universal blueprint”), but emphasizes the story’s “continuation follows” openness.
- **Signed**: Yuri Saprykin (Юрий Сапрыкин), “публицист, шеф-редактор «Рамблер-Афиша»”.

## Prologue (pp. 7–12)
- Opens with a cinematic St. Petersburg street scene near the Singer/Zinger House (Дом Зингера) and Kazan Cathedral area; sets the flow/traffic metaphor.
- A negotiation scene: an expat director from a major e-commerce player tries to set terms inside VK’s territory; VK team pushes back hard on commission for the “Желания” (“Wishes”) gifting service.
- Ends with a meta-authorial note: the author frames the investigation as a “thriller about fighting for freedom in binary code,” cites pop-culture references (e.g., *Pirates of Silicon Valley*) and includes a Douglas Adams footnote (“So long, and thanks for all the fish”).

## Chapter 1 (pp. 13–22)
