# Chapter Summaries

## Preface
Yuri Saprykin introduces Durov as a unique figure in modern Russia—a libertarian hero or a cynical manipulator? He compares the story to "The Social Network" but with a distinct Russian flavor of banditry and police state pressure.

## Prologue
Opens with a tense scene in the Singer House. Police/SWAT team is at the door (2011 elections context). Durov is calm, almost detached, checking his phone. Sets the theme of conflict between the free internet and the state.

## Chapter 2: The Forum
University years at SPbGU. Creation of Durov.com (library) and SPBGU.ru (forum). Pavel learns community management, uses sockpuppets to incite debate, realizes the power of ego and status. Meets Vyacheslav Mirilashvili (Slava), who brings the idea of Facebook.

## Chapter 3: The Wall
