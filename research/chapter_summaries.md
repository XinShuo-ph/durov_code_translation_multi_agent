## Предисловие / Preface (Pages 5-6)
**Author**: Юрий Сапрыкин (Yuri Saprykin), Chief Editor of Rambler-Afisha

### Summary
Saprykin frames the book's importance in the context of Russia's "lost narratives" - stories of immense dramatic potential that go undocumented. He notes that VKontakte's blue logo appears on every screen in Russia, yet few understand its origins or its enigmatic creator.

### Key Themes
- Russia lacks documentation of its transformative stories
- VKontakte exists in a strange liminal space - ubiquitous yet poorly understood
- Durov is positioned as an exceptional, eccentric figure
- The book is an "adventure story" with no clear ending
- Durov embodies freedom by his very existence, rather than fighting for it

### Notable Quotes
- "Нынешняя Россия – это страна потерянных сюжетов" (Today's Russia is a country of lost narratives)
- Durov doesn't fight for freedom - he "утверждает ее самим фактом своего существования" (affirms it by the very fact of his existence)
