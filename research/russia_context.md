# Russia / Russian internet context (2000s–early 2010s) — translator notes

## Why this matters

The book mixes tech history with distinctly Russian social cues: formality levels, “who has power”, post-Soviet bureaucracy, and early Runet (Russian-language internet) culture.

## Quick cultural anchors

- **St. Petersburg vs. Moscow**: Petersburg often framed as more “intellectual/European” in tone; Moscow as power/finance/centralization. Use cautiously—these are stereotypes that can appear in dialogue/narration.
- **Post-Soviet institutions**: paperwork, hierarchy, and informal networks (“contacts”) can drive plot beats; avoid flattening into generic “government red tape” if the original is sharper.
- **Runet (Рунет)**: Russian-language internet ecosystem; early social networks and forums had their own slang and meme culture.

## Common slang terms (examples)

| RU term | Rough sense | EN suggestion | 中文建议 | 日本語案 |
|--------|-------------|--------------|---------|---------|
| гопник | street tough / lowbrow thug stereotype | “gopnik” (with note) / “street thug” | “街头混混/痞子”（可加注） | 「ゴプニク」（注）/「不良」 |
| ботаник | nerd / bookworm stereotype | “nerd” / “bookworm” | “书呆子/理工宅” | 「ガリ勉」「オタク」（慎重） |

## Register reminders

- Russian often compresses **social distance** into naming/address; don’t lose this in EN and over-formalize in 中文/日本語 unless required by scene.
- When the narrator is ironic or judgmental, keep it **crisp**—short clauses, confident tone.
