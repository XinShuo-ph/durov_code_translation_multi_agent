# Russian Tech Context (2000s-2010s)

## The Landscape
- **Runet**: The Russian-language segment of the internet. Developed somewhat in isolation due to language barrier and strong local talent.
- **Key Players**:
    - **Yandex**: The "Russian Google". Dominant search engine, founded by Arkady Volozh.
    - **Mail.ru**: The "Russian Yahoo". Started as email, grew into a massive holding (social networks, games, messenger).
    - **Rambler**: Early portal and search engine, lost dominance.
    - **Kaspersky Lab**: Cybersecurity giant.

## Cultural Factors
- **Piracy**: In the 2000s, copyright enforcement was lax. Torrents and direct downloads were the norm. VK's success was partly due to its massive, user-uploaded library of music and movies.
- **Freedom**: The internet was viewed as the last bastion of free speech in Russia as TV came under state control.
- **"Copycat" Myth**: Western observers often dismissed Russian tech as clones (VK vs Facebook, Yandex vs Google), but local players often had superior tech adapted to local morphology (Russian language is complex) and infrastructure.

## Social Context
- **St. Petersburg vs Moscow**:
    - **Moscow**: Money, corporate, political power, "glamour".
    - **St. Petersburg**: Intellectual, cultural, rebellious, "hacker spirit". VK being based in SPb (Singer House) was a statement of independence from the Moscow establishment.
- **The "Intelligentsia"**: Durov's background (philology, classical education) appealed to the intellectual elite, distinguishing VK from the "mass market" Odnoklassniki.

## Political Environment
- **2000-2010**: Relative freedom for the internet. State ignored it as "niche".
- **2011-2012**: The "Snow Revolution" protests. The internet proved to be a powerful mobilizing tool.
- **2012-Onwards**: The "Sovereign Internet" era begins. Laws on blacklists (Roskomnadzor), data localization, and pressure on tech companies to cooperate with FSB (SORM systems).

## Glossary of Terms
- **Gopnik**: Subculture of lower-class youth, often associated with aggression, tracksuits, and petty crime.
- **Botanik** (Nerd): Intellectual, socially awkward person. The book title "Code of Durov" plays on the "Revenge of the Nerds" theme.
- **Major** (Мажор): Rich kid, golden youth.
- **Khabarovsk**: Often referenced in context of geography/distance.
- **Dom Knigi (Singer House)**: Iconic Art Nouveau building in SPb, VK HQ.
