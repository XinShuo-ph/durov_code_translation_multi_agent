# Russia (2000s–early 2010s) — Context Notes for Translation

These notes focus on the cultural/business background that frequently “sits behind” the book’s scenes.

## Post-Soviet business environment (late 1990s → 2000s)
- **Rapid privatization aftermath**: property/asset disputes, informal enforcement (“крышa” / protection), and blurred lines between business, security services, and politics.
- **By mid/late 2000s**: “street” violence is less visible in major cities, but influence shifts to more formalized power structures and “institutional” pressure (courts, regulators, tax, police).

## Russian internet (“Runet”) specifics
- **Fast-growing audience**: increasing broadband availability and cheap access in big cities; internet becomes mass-market.
- **Platforms as public squares**: social networks and blogs become core spaces for identity, media distribution, and politics.
- **Copyright norms**: historically lax enforcement and widespread piracy; platforms often grew by tolerating user-uploaded media, then had to negotiate with rights-holders later.

## St. Petersburg flavor (important in the book)
- A distinct “imperial” city aesthetic and intellectual tradition, with gritty outskirts and strong local subcultures.
- The book’s imagery often contrasts **high culture** (literature, architecture, symbolism) with **street reality** (gopniks, rough neighborhoods).

## 2011–2012 political moment
- Large protests in Moscow/St. Petersburg after parliamentary elections; heightened sensitivity around online organizing.
- For big platforms, pressure increases around **content removal**, **user data**, and **control of information flows**.

## Common cultural terms (translation notes)
- **гопник**: rough street youth / petty thug stereotype; keep as “gopnik” with a short note on first mention (ZH: “街头混混/小流氓（gopnik）”, JA: “ゴプニク（不良っぽい若者）”).
- **силовики**: security-service/power-structure people (police/FSS/MVD-linked); typically translate as “security services / силовые структуры”.
