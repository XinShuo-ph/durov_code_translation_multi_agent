# Russian Tech & Cultural Context

## The "RuNet" Phenomenon
- **Self-Sufficiency**: Russia is one of the few countries where domestic internet giants dominate over global ones (Yandex > Google, VK > Facebook, Ozon/Wildberries > Amazon).
- **Language Barrier**: Cyrillic script and Russian language acted as a natural moat protecting local services.

## Key Players (circa 2006-2012)
- **Yandex**: The "Russian Google". Founded by Arkady Volozh and Ilya Segalovich. Technologically advanced search engine.
- **Mail.ru Group**: Originally a webmail service, grew into a massive holding company (games, social networks Odnoklassniki & Moi Mir). Led by Yuri Milner (DST) and later Dmitry Grishin. Known for aggressive M&A.
- **Rambler**: Early pioneer, lost ground to Yandex.
- **Kaspersky Lab**: Cybersecurity giant.

## Political Environment
- **2000s**: Relatively free internet. Government focused on TV control, ignoring the web.
- **2011-2012 Protests**: Turning point. The "Snow Revolution" was organized largely via Facebook and VK. Government realized the power of social media.
- **SORM**: System for Operative Search Activities. Technical framework for FSB monitoring of telecoms and internet traffic. VK was under constant pressure to cooperate.
- **Censorship**: Post-2012, laws on "blacklists" of websites, data localization, and "sovereign internet" began to emerge.

## Cultural Aspects
- **Piracy**: In the 2000s, copyright enforcement was lax. VK's music and video functionality (mostly user-uploaded pirated content) was a massive competitive advantage over Facebook.
- **St. Petersburg vs. Moscow**:
    - **Moscow**: Money, corporate HQs, government, bureaucracy.
    - **St. Petersburg**: Cultural capital, "Spirit of the Neva", home of VK (Zinger House office). Durov emphasized this distance from Moscow's corruption/politics.
- **"Copycat" vs. Innovation**: VK started as a Facebook clone (functionally and visually), but rapidly diverged with features better suited for the Russian market (file sharing, groups).

## Terminology
- **Runet**: The Russian-language segment of the internet.
- **Khabr (Habrahabr)**: Popular tech blog/community (similar to Hacker News + Medium).
- **Gopnik**: Subculture of lower-class youth (Durov sometimes mocked them, or contrasted VK's "elite" initial audience with the masses).
