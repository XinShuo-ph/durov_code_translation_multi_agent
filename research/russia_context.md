# Russian Tech & Cultural Context

## The "Runet" (Russian Internet)
- **Self-Sufficiency**: Russia is one of the few countries where domestic tech giants (Yandex, VK, Mail.ru) successfully competed with and often outperformed US giants (Google, Facebook).
- **Engineering Talent**: Strong Soviet legacy of mathematics and physics education produced world-class programmers (e.g., Nikolai Durov).
- **Piracy Culture**: Early Runet was characterized by rampant copyright infringement (torrents, mp3 sites), which was seen as normal access to culture.

## Key Players
- **Yandex**: "Russian Google". Search, maps, taxi, etc. Founded by Arkady Volozh.
- **Mail.ru Group (now VK)**: Originally email service, became a massive conglomerate owning social networks (Odnoklassniki, VK), games, etc. Founded by Yuri Milner (DST).
- **Kaspersky Lab**: Cybersecurity giant.

## St. Petersburg vs. Moscow
- **Moscow**: Center of money, government, and corporate business.
- **St. Petersburg**: Cultural capital, home of VK. Viewed as more intellectual, European, and independent. Durov intentionally kept VK in St. Petersburg to stay away from Moscow influence.

## Political Context (2006-2014)
- **Early 2000s**: Relative freedom on the internet.
- **2011-2012 Protests**: "Snow Revolution" or Bolotnaya protests. Organized largely via Facebook and VK. Marked a turning point where the state began to see the internet as a threat.
- **Censorship**: Post-2012, laws were introduced to block sites (Roskomnadzor), require data localization, and demand encryption keys.

## Cultural Terms
- **Gopnik (Гопник)**: Lower-class street youth, associated with tracksuits and petty crime.
- **Botan (Ботаник)**: Nerd/geek. Durov champions the "revenge of the nerds".
- **Vkontakte (ВКонтакте)**: Literally "InContact" or "InTouch".
- **Durov's Dog**: The "Spotty" dog icon used for charity and eventually the logo.
- **Singer House (Dom Knigi)**: Iconic building in St. Petersburg, VK HQ. Symbol of status and tradition.

## Educational Context
- **SPbGU (St. Petersburg State University)**: Durov's alma mater.
- **Academic Gymnasium**: Elite school where Durov studied.
