# Russia (2000s–early 2010s) — Context Notes (M0.6 draft)

These notes are **translation-facing**: enough context to localize references without turning the book into a textbook.

## Internet & media landscape
- **Runet (Рунет)**: “Russian internet” as a cultural space with its own norms, memes, and platforms.
- **Piracy norms**: in the 2000s/early 2010s, piracy and “free content” were widespread; legal enforcement was uneven and politicized.
- **Social networks as infrastructure**: for many young users, VK became a default identity + messaging + media hub.

## Business environment
- **Fast-growing but unstable**: startups scaled quickly amid unclear rules, informal governance, and opaque investor relationships.
- **Power asymmetry**: successful tech businesses could face pressure from large incumbents and/or state actors.

## Political / censorship pressures (careful with time specifics)
- The book may reference law enforcement requests, moderation demands, and “informal” pressure.
- Translation should avoid adding claims not present in the text; use neutral wording, and add brief translator notes only when a reference is otherwise opaque.
