# Russia (2000s–early 2010s) — Context Notes for Translation

Goal: give translators quick cultural/political/economic context that frequently explains “why characters act like that” in the book.

## Post-Soviet business reality (common background)

- **Weak institutions / informal power**: formal rules exist, but outcomes often depend on networks, leverage, and “who can apply pressure.”
- **Rapid wealth creation + insecurity**: fortunes can appear quickly and disappear quickly; this shapes the book’s tone (“shakespearean plots,” sudden reversals).
- **Media + PR**: public narratives are contested; “official” stories may conflict with lived reality.

## Internet culture in RU context

- **Runet**: shorthand for the Russian-speaking internet ecosystem (forums, portals, early social networks).
- **Piratical norms** (historically): broad tolerance for unlicensed media sharing; later clashes with copyright enforcement and platform liability.
- **Youth subcultures**: slang terms like «ботаник», «гопник» can carry class/region connotations; avoid overly literal translations.

## State pressure & censorship (translation handling)

- The book may allude to:
  - content takedown demands,
  - law enforcement requests,
  - political sensitivities.
- Translation strategy:
  - keep wording **factual and neutral** unless the original is explicitly sarcastic or accusatory,
  - use brief translator notes when a term implies institutional practices unfamiliar to non-RU readers.

## St. Petersburg vs Moscow (recurring contrast)

- Petersburg is often portrayed as:
  - more “European”/intellectual in self-image,
  - a cradle for certain tech/cultural circles.
- Moscow is often framed as:
  - capital power, money, corporate politics.

Preserve these contrasts where the author uses them; they’re part of the narrative texture.
